Indexing
===============================================================================

Indexes allow the database application to find data fast; without reading the whole table

DELETE command and TRUNCATE command
===============================================================================

DELETE command: DELETE command is used to delete rows from a table based on the condition that we provide in a WHERE clause.

TRUNCATE command: TRUNCATE command is used to remove all rows (complete data) from a table. It is similar to the DELETE command with no WHERE clause.

database languages
===============================================================================

Data Definition Language (DDL) e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME, etc. All these commands are used for updating the data that?s why they are known as Data Definition Language.

Data Manipulation Language (DML) e.g., SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, etc. These commands are used for the manipulation of already updated data that's why they are the part of Data Manipulation Language.

DATA Control Language (DCL) e.g., GRANT and REVOKE. These commands are used for giving and removing the user access on the database. So, they are the part of Data Control Language.

Transaction Control Language (TCL) e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT. These are the commands used for managing transactions in the database. TCL is used for managing the changes made by DML.

Key
===============================================================================

Primary key: The Primary key is an attribute in a table that can uniquely identify each record in a table. It is compulsory for every table.

Candidate key: The Candidate key is an attribute or set of an attribute which can uniquely identify a tuple. The Primary key can be selected from these attributes.

Super key: The Super key is a set of attributes which can uniquely identify a tuple. Super key is a superset of the candidate key.

Foreign key: The Foreign key is a primary key from one table, which has a relationship with another table. It acts as a cross-reference between tables.


B-Tree
===============================================================================

Following is an example of B-Tree of minimum order 5.

The B+ tree is a balanced binary search tree. It follows a multi-level index format

Transaction property(ACID properties)
===============================================================================

The transaction has the four properties. These are used to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the transaction.

Atomicity : It states that all operations of the transaction take place at once if not, the transaction is aborted.

Consistency : The integrity constraints are maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction.

Isolation : It shows that the data which is used at the time of execution of a transaction cannot be used by the second transaction until the first one is completed.

Durability : The durability property is used to indicate the performance of the database's consistent state. It states that the transaction made the permanent changes.

Normalization
===============================================================================

Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations.
Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and updation anomalies. So, it helps to minimize the redundancy in relations.

.. code:: SQL


      1NF	A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.
      2NF	A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
      3NF	A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.
      4NF	A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd normal form and has no multi-valued dependency.
      5NF	A relation is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and not contains any join dependency and joining should be lossless.


DELETE
===============================================================================

The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

.. code:: SQL

   DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste'; 
   
GROUP BY
===============================================================================

The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

.. code:: SQL

      SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
      FROM Customers
      GROUP BY Country;
      
HAVING
===============================================================================      

The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

.. code:: SQL

      SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
      FROM Customers
      GROUP BY Country
      HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
   

CREATE TABLE - Count the Number of Rows
===============================================================================

.. code:: SQL

      CREATE TABLE geeks(
          id int(20) , 
          name varchar(200));

      INSERT INTO geeks(id,name) values(1,'nikhil');
      INSERT INTO geeks(id,name) values(2,'kartik');

      SELECT COUNT(id) as id_count FROM geeks

SQL query to find second highest salary?
===============================================================================

.. code:: SQL

    select FirstName, max(Salary) from employees
    where Salary not in (select max(Salary) from employees)
    
    or
    
    select FirstName, max(Salary) from employees 
    where Salary < (select max(Salary) from employees)

SQL query to find Nth highest salary?
===============================================================================

.. code:: SQL

      SELECT name, salary 
      FROM #Employee e1 
      WHERE N-1 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) FROM #Employee e2 
      WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary)


SQL Query to Find the Highest Salary of Each Department
===============================================================================

`Geeks <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-query-to-find-the-highest-salary-of-each-department/>`_

.. code:: SQL

      SELECT DEPT_ID, MAX(SALARY) FROM department GROUP BY DEPT_ID;

How to get the alternate rows or records from table in sql server
===============================================================================

.. code:: SQL

      select ID, NAME from department where mod(ID, 2) = 0;
      
      
Find Duplicate Values in a SQL 
===============================================================================

.. code:: SQL

      SELECT username, email, COUNT(*)
      FROM users
      GROUP BY username, email
      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
